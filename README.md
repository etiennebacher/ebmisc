This is a list of various functions I made. There's a bit of everything, not necessarily related, and **not necessarily thoroughly tested**. Anyone can use if it helps.

`unused_functions()`: find functions that are not used in a list of R files.

`is_package()`: detect if the environment is an R package.

`make_card_project()` and `make_grid_project()`: create a grid layout and add cards in it (used in distill website)
